Biography
=========
I am Litton Industries John M. Leonis Distinguished Associate Professor in the Department of ECE at the University of Arizona. I received the B.Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT Kanpur) in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree in ECE from the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) in 2010. From 2010 to 2012, I was a post-doctoral research associate at Princeton University. Prior to joining the University of Arizona in Fall 2015, I was a Research Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech from 2012-2015. I received NSF CAREER Award in 2017, and the 2018 Keysight Early Career Professor Award.

My current research interests are in information theory with applications to

* Security and Data Privacy

* Machine Learning (including distributed/federated learning with a focus on privacy, fairness, robustness and efficiency)

* Wireless Communications and Signal Processing
